<h1 style="text-align:center; font-size:40px; font-weight:normal;">Waste Management</h1>
<div class="center">
<h5>How many tons of solid waste will your city produce per year?</h5>
<p>The average person in the United States produces about 0.9 tons of solid waste annually. Thanks to efforts to public service campaigns and regulation through taxing, our city has reduced this number. Animal Crossing 2 has a population of 100,000, with each person producing half a ton (0.5) of solid waste per year. In total, the city will produce <b>50,000 tons of solid waste per year.</b></p>
<h5>What taxes, mandates, or laws will your city be using?</h5>
<p>Animal Crossing 2 has emphasized <b>reducing waste from the source</b>, and has used negative reinforcement as a tool. We are taxing both regular and excessive production of waste, which lowers it greatly and also increases our budget for waste disposal.</p>
<p>The city will facilitate flea markets and swap meets where people can buy or reuse items instead of disposing them; while this will cost some money to implement, they will help reduce waste. We will also provide citizens with reusable products for free, which will cost a lot but reduce waste greatly.</p>
<p>Public service and educational campaigns will also be emphasized in our effort to reduce waste. These campaigns cost money to host but will spread greater awareness.</p>
<h5>What factors made you choose the government mandates that you chose?</h5>
<p>Since landfills and municipal solid waste is a huge issue in most large cities, Animal Crossing 2 has chosen to focus on approaching waste management from an environmentally friendly perspective. This means sacrificing some economic development, increasing taxes, and spending more money on "greener" waste disposal methods like recycling and composting. Taxing citizens will also motivate them to recycle and reduce waste. We also choose to use the income we receive from those taxes specifically for waste management. At the same time, we feel strongly about upholding our moral standards and city values- certain methods of curbing waste production would violate those values. For instance, the city has chosen to not implement jail time as a punishment for creating excessive waste because incarceration often targets the most vulnerable populations and creates unrest, rather than addressing the root problems causing increased solid waste production.</p>
<br>
<h1>What methods will your city use for its solid waste?</h1>
<h3>Animal Crossing 2 will use four means of solid waste disposal.</h3>
<ul>
<li>10% of our city's waste will be incinerated</li>
<li>60% of our city's waste will be recycled</li>
<li>20% of our city's waste will be composted</li>
<li>the remaining 10% of our city's waste will go to the landfill</li>
</ul>

<h2>What factors influenced the solid waste disposal methods you chose?</h2>
<p>Composting and recycling makes up the majority of our waste disposal but it costs too much to fully integrate them. Additionally, only so much of the city's waste can be either recycled or composted, and much of the other waste must be processed through other means. For most cities, only about 20-35% of waste can be composted, and only around 70% of municipal solid waste can be recycled.</p>

<h1>What is your total cost?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Our waste management budget per year is $3,129,117. </li>
<li>Incineration costs $15 per ton of waste burned.</li>
<li>Recycling costs $75 per ton of waste recycled.</li>
<li>Composting costs $65 per ton of waste composted.</li>
<li>And the landfill costs $5 per ton, encompassing anything not disposed of by other means.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given that again our city is predicted to produce 50,000 tons of solid waste per year, our calculations are as follows:<br>
($15*0.1*50000)+($75*0.6*50000)+($65*0.2*50000)+($5*0.1*50000)</p>

<h3>Our total waste disposal plan will cost $3,000,000 per year.</h3>
<br>
<h1>Incineration - Benefits and Disadvantages</h1>
<p>Incineration is a waste treatment method which involves burning various types of waste and converting them into ash, gas, and heat. The heat produced from incineration can be converted into electricity and used as a source of energy.</p>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>

<ul>
<li>Incineration is good for disposing of waste in locations where there isn't a lot of land to host landfills.
</li>
<li>It is also extremely helpful when disposing of hazardous or toxic waste, where the high temperature will destroy pathogens and toxins. 
</li>
<li>The heat also generates electricity, which is why incineration is sometimes referred to as a "waste-to-energy" plant. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incineration#Technology">wikipedia</a>)
</li>
<li>Faster clean-up method, can be helpful for emergencies or to prevent immediate harm to people or the environment. (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-04/documents/a_citizens_guide_to_incineration.pdf">epa</a>)

<ul>
<li>Incineration is known to release large amounts of air pollution. This will harm nearby communities.
</li>
<li>Not all of the waste is eliminated- residual ash remains which also requires disposal. This ash is harmful to the environment and generally ends up going to the landfill.

<h1>Recycling - Benefits and Disadvantages</h1>
<p>Recycling is a process which includes collecting waste, sorting and processing it into raw materials, and remanufacturing it into new products. By buying and using products that contain recycled or recyclable materials, consumers can help facilitate the process (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/recycling-basics">EPA</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li>The recycling industry creates a significant amount of jobs and revenue (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/smm/recycling-economic-information-rei-report">EPA</a>)</li>
<li>Greener alternative to incineration and landfills. It reduces greenhouse gas emissions and saves energy.</li>
<li>Conserves resources- manufacturing of products consumes a lot of resources and energy and has a significant impact on the environment.</li>

</ul>

</td>

</table>

<h1>Compost - Benefits and Disadvantages</h1>
<p>Compost is the controlled decomposition of organic materials in the presence of oxygen, turning waste into fertilizer. The process of composting includes combining organic waste types, adding a bulking agent such as paper or wood chips, and allowing the compost to stabilize through a curing process. (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-10/documents/master_swmg_10-20-20_0.pdf">source</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li>Compost helps improve soil quality</li>
<li>Suppresses plant diseases and pests</li>
<li>Organic fertilizers reduce the need for chemical fertilizers</li>
<li>Eco-friendly</li>
<li>Can be incorporated alongside other forms of organic waste management, which alleviate some disadvantages. For example, AD (anaerobic digestion) involves turning organic content into biogas, and reduces pathogens more compared to composting.</li>
<li>Can establish a greater number of smaller-scale facilities as a result of more decentralized waste management systems.</li>

<h1>Landfill - Benefits and Disadvantages</h1>
<p>Landfills are areas designated specifically for municipal solid waste. Waste is disposed of by burying it and then covering it with soil, with many layers accumulating over time. It is the oldest and most common form of waste disposal and has evolved over time to become more environmentally friendly.</p>
 <table style="">

    <th>Benefits</th>
    <th>Disadvantages</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<ul>
<li>Landfills are cheap and convenient</li>
<li>Healthy operating practices can reduce the severity of some disadvantages- help reduce odor, control litter, insects, and rodents, and protect public health. (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/landfills/municipal-solid-waste-landfills">EPA</a>)</li>
<li>Methane can be used as an energy source. (<a href="https://www.mswmanagement.com/landfills/article/13023301/what-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-benefits-of-landfills">msw management</a>)</li>

<ul>
<li>Contains toxins from electronic waste, such as mercury, arsenic, cadmium, PVC, solvents, acids and lead.</li>
<li>Leachate (the liquid formed when waste breaks down in the landfill and water filters through that waste. This liquid is highly toxic and can pollute land, groundwater and water ways.) (<a href="https://www.unisanuk.com/what-is-a-landfill-why-are-landfills-bad-for-the-environment/">source</a>)</li>
<li>Greenhouse gas emissions: When organic material such as food scraps and green waste is put in landfill, it is generally compacted down and covered. This removes the oxygen and causes it to break down in an anaerobic process. Eventually this releases methane, a greenhouse gas that is about 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Landfill gas comprises 35-55% methane and 30-44% carbon dioxide.

<p>Our goal when it came to waste management was to incorporate all levels of the EPA's <a href="https://www.epa.gov/smm/sustainable-materials-management-non-hazardous-materials-and-waste-management-hierarchy">Waste Management Hierarchy</a>. What this hierarchy indicates essentially is that it's easier and preferred to eliminate the amount of waste produced initially than it is to treat and dispose of it, with the steps going in order of most to least preferred. In this case, we've opted to stick to methods that aligned closely with Animal Crossing 2's mission and guiding values.</p>
<p>Through taxing and mandates, we achieve a significant waste reduction right off the bat. Taxing regular and excessive production of waste discourages people from doing activities that produce more waste and also encourage them to dispose of waste through more environmentally friendly methods. However, we've chosen to use less severe means of negative reinforcement because that's what aligns with our city's values, compared to incarceration which would greatly reduce waste but it would cause a lot of unnecessary suffering. We have also chosen to spend more money to facilitate public education programs and flea markets to encourage reusing items and reducing waste. By implementing these mandates, we've been able to reduce the city's yearly waste production by 45,000 tons. These steps also help lower the cost required to process the remaining waste through the other methods down the WMH.</p>
<p>The next step, recycling/composting, is seen in our waste treatment methods.. well.. recycling and composting. While both of these methods are significantly more expensive than other more traditional methods, they are more environmentally friendly, conserve material, and create jobs around a healthier industry. The taxes we impose on waste production in the city will also help offset this cost. However, only so much of the waste in the city can be processed through those means. The rest of the waste must be processed using methods that can act more as a "catch-all". This is where the final two steps come in; incineration and landfills can be used to produce energy, which is known as "waste to energy" plants. The downside to them is that they also produce a massive amount of pollution, which is why they are lower on the WMH and also why Animal Crossing strives to use those means for only 20% of its waste. However, we are also focusing on ways to better contain pollution and make all waste management methods more environmentally and people friendly. An example of this looks like creating more, smaller facilities that are more closely regulated to prevent contamination. There is no better time than now to start focusing more on decentralizing waste management systems and focusing on greener technologies.</p>

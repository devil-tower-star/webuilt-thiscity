<div class="center">
<h5>Why do we need new cities?</h5>
<p>The construction of new cities is oftentimes far less expensive than implementing updated infrastructure in existing cities. A brand new city allows for new work & housing opportunities in an urban area, as well as general opportunities for equality and safety (which tend to be hard to find in existing cities). When building a brand new city, existing roads, organizations and even rules & regulations are not an issue, since they do not yet exist within the area. </p>

<h5>What particular need is there for your city to exist, particularly where you are locating it?</h5>
<p>Animal Crossing 2, Florida sits in place of Miami, Florida. In this hypothetical world, Animal Crossing 2 was founded to tie together the region and create an accessible & diverse environment for people to come live & work in. </p>

<h5>What is an issue that new cities face?</h5>
<p>Often times, the prospect of economic success that comes from the construction of new cities will result in rushing the project. New cities are extremely expensive, especially considering the ambitious technological advancements planned for them. (For example, Ordos Kangbashi's enormous price tag of 161 billion dollars.)</p>

<h5>How will your city address this issue?</h5>
<p>To address this issue, we will ensure that our city's development is clearly planned & scheduled so to avoid the all too common rushed process. Additionally, we will not make promises we cannot keep. Many city development projects suffer from their need of loans (oftentimes from foreign banks) that they may be unable to pay. We will plan ahead for these potential financial complications.</p><br>
<img src="twoguys.png" style="width:100%;"><br>
<h5>Why do cities need a purpose?</h5>
<p>It's important to establish clear purposes and directions when managing organizations on any scale; in this case, the organization in question is a city. Having a purpose involves laying out a set of goals and the concrete action steps to accomplish those goals. The purpose of a city can also encompass the values it wishes to demonstrate when pursuing those goals.</p>
<p>For instance, the United Nations has adopted a set of <a href="https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals"> Sustainable Development Goals</a>, which include goals such as "No Poverty" and "Affordable and Clean Energy". These define the organization's direction in multiple aspects of society (environmental restoration, social justice, economic development) and also give those who are affected an idea of what to expect. In this context, it also unites a large amount of groups and individuals.</p>
<p>A purpose is not only important for those who manage or contribute to the development of a city, but also for those living within or interacting with city. Those who live in the city have purpose to consistently refer back to, to ensure none of those values are being violated. Having these goals listed out and accessible to everyone will help pinpoint if an action the city is taking conflicts with a given purpose and what is needed to remedy that conflict.</p>
<p>Careful planning of goals and missions is needed to reconcile the conflict between different purposes. The pursuit of capital and profit often comes at the sacrifice of the environment and individual wellbeing, which makes it essential to balance those pillars in a community meant to serve its people. When we as a city engage in commercial endeavors, business, or trade with other cities or groups, we also want to ensure that those groups align with our own values and purpose. It is important to consider what statement we are making when we perform certain actions, who is being helped, who is being hurt, and what narrative is being pushed.</p>
<h5>What is the purpose of your city? </h5>
<p>Animal Crossing 2 aims to foster a safe community where people can access the services they need, as well as continue economic development for the public good. We envision a city in which people can freely express themselves and shape the community they live in. We strive to develop healthy relationships with the cities and communities outside of our own.</p>

<p>We will achieve this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Focusing on free and accessible public services when pursuing economic development.</li>
<li>Implementing public transportation such as trains and buses over other means of transportation.</li>
<li>Planning city infrastructure around creating a "walkable city".</li>
<li>Limiting carbon emissions from a given source.</li>
<li>Devoting resources to environment restoration and disaster relief.</li>
<li>Providing thorough evaluations of business practices and ensuring they are beneficial to consumers.</li>
<li>Extensive community outreach within and outside of the city, organizing public events to promote culture and business growth.</li>
<li>Forming alliances and partnerships with other organizations that align with our values.</li>
</ul>

<h5>How will the members of your city resolve conflict?</h5>
<p>Conflict is inevitable as a city is comprised of a huge amount of individuals and it is impossible for everyone to be getting along at all times.</p>
<p>While it is true that violence and suppression tend to only work in the short term and over time build up a lot of resentment within the community, they have the capacity to be very silly teehee methods of conflict resolution. Therefore, one method which members of our city will use to resolve conflicts is violence. Every single person, starting at the age of 12, will be given a net that can be used to hit other people. Hitting netless people is prohibited and will be punished by a net hit. These nets are made from official Animal Crossing 2 material and are harmless as they are not the main method of conflict resolution.</p>
 
<p>Our main method of conflict resolution will be done through conversation. Animal Crossing 2 aims to project the voices of its constituents and facilitate open dialogues. We will apply concepts such as direct democracy at multiple levels, which will influence our decision-making and ensure that people do not feel ignored or ostracized.</p>
<p>When opposition to certain policies or movements arise, the city will be proactive in reaching out and compromising, rather than trying to triumph over the opposition. While it is important to align closely with the values we've established in our mission statement, it is more constructive to approach others from a curious mindset and wanting to know their perspective. The action step that will help facilitate this plan is to integrate it closely with city politics and community events, so that there are many outlets available for people to engage in discussion. We will also ensure that people feel safe and welcome throughout this whole process. However, if our differences are truly irreconcilable, I will hit you with a net.</p>
 
<p>It is not easy to control or manage the consequences of such conflicts, which is why Animal Crossing 2 will also dedicate resources towards prevention of harm and supporting those who are affected.</p>

<h5>Why is this important?</h5>
<p>This is so important because it is far easier to prevent a conflict from starting and branching out than it is to clean up and mediate the aftermath. If we can plan in a way that avoids conflict but is also capable of addressing them when they arise, that will be essential for building a positive and healthy community within a city.</p>

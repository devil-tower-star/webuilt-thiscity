<h1> Climate</h1>
<ul>
	<li>The average temperature is 28°C or 82°F. Hottest during the summer but warm year round due to the current from the Gulf stream. </li>
	<li>Annual precipitation is 67.7 inches, with the wettest month being in June and driest being January. It is also highly humid in the summer.</li>
	<li>Hurricanes for days. and floods</li>
	<li>Close to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic Ocean- has coasts near both.</li>
	<li>This area of Florida was originally covered by sea. Drastic changes in sea level caused the formation of a special type of bedrock. Miami Limestone is partially composed of fossils and ooids, a grain composed of calcium carbonate.</li>
</ul>

<h1> City </h1>
<h3>What industries are located in your city? How does your population make a living? </h3>
	<p>A great amount of Animal Crossing 2's revenue comes from our tourism industry. We are home to a rather popular theme park, but many are attracted to this city by the plentiful public parks and the easy access to all parts of the city. Citizens can make a living in the many shops & restaurants around the city, as well as employment opportunities within the finance industry.</p>
<h3>Does your city grow its own food? If so, where? If not, where do they get it from?</h3>
	<p>We do not have the necessary means to grow quality food directly in the city, so the majority of our produce is purchased from local farming communities as well as imported produce from out of state our other countries. </p>
<h3>What values, philosophies, and beliefs does your city have?</h3>
	<p>Animal Crossing 2 is a place focused first and foremost on accessibility & environmentally friendly forms of transportation. </p>
<h3>What rules does your city have?</h3>
	<p>Even distribution of necessary resources throughout the city. If a citizen is evicted from their home without a clear or fair reason, they may take their landlord to court over the matter free of charge. Murder & theft & such are not recommended. </p>
<img src="hurricane.jpg" style="width:50%; margin-left:25%;">
<h1>Environmental Issues</h1>
	<p>Climate change has resulted in an increase of sea levels everywhere, & our coastal city is suffering from considerably more floods because of this. Invasive species are also a threat to the native wildlife.</p>

<h2><u>Hurricanes and Floods</u></h2>
	<p>Hurricanes are naturally caused by a low pressure area moving through warm waters which attracts rain and thunderstorms. This causes air to rise into the storm and create more thunderstorms and clouds which releases more heat to power the storm. Florida sticks out and is in direct proximity of hurricane activity which explains why it experiences hurricanes more often than other states. Flooding as a result of hurricanes is also a threat. While hurricanes are caused naturally, we believe warming waters as a result of climate change is increasing the frequency of hurricanes.</p>
<h3>What damage does this cause in the short-term? In the long-term? </h3>
	<p>From 2000 to the present, hurricanes have resulted in over 120 billion dollars in damages. There have been over 200 deaths and many more people injured or displaced. Many homeowners also struggle to gain access to insurance or resources that will help them prepare for or navigate the effects of a hurricane. Housing is currently not sufficient to protect against hurricanes either. Loss of natural shelter and environments will also decrease the biodiversity of native species.</p>
<h3>What are potential solutions to this issue?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Redesign housing to be more resistant to flooding</li>
	<li>Set aside resources for environment restoration</li>
	<li>Socialized healthcare</li>
</ul>

<h2><u>Alligators</u></h2>
<h3>Is this naturally occurring or manmade? If manmade, what caused it?</h3>
	<p>Alligator attacks are natural occurrences. The creatures simply live here.</p>
<h3>What damage does this cause in the short-term? In the long-term? </h3>
	<p>Tourists may be frightened by alligator attacks & decide on a different location for their summer vacation, throwing a wrench in our tourism industry. The health of citizens & visitors alike is affected by these attacks as well because those beasts will hurt them. Unfortunate! </p>
<h3>What are potential solutions to this issue?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Building the city to accommodate & keep citizens safe from alligator presence should be a priority. </li>
	<li>MY GOD DON'T TRY TO WRESTLE THEM</li>
</ul>

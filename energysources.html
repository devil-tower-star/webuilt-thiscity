<div class="center">
<h5>How many kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year will each person be expected to use? If your government is using any taxes or mandates, mention this. How many kWh per year does your city use in total? </h5>
<p>Our city (Animal Crossing 2) has hot weather, so villagers will have A/C on very often which will increase energy usage. We also plan to spend money to mandate energy-efficient insulation in buildings, and tax excessive uses of energy which will increase our budget.</p>
<p>Overall, the average villager will use 15,300 kWh per year, and yearly it will use 1,530,000,000 kWh.</p>
<h5>How will your city get its energy?</h5>
<p>Our city will use coal, wind, and solar power: 20% coal, 30% wind, and 50% solar energy. What this means is that 20% of our city's energy will come from coal, 30% will come from wind, and 50% will come from solar power.</p>
<h5>What is the total cost of this?</h5>
<p>Our budget per year is $326,250,000. Coal costs $0.05 per kWh to implement, while wind and solar cost $0.25. Our energy usage is expected to cost $321,300,000. </p>

<h5>What is your total cost? How much CO2 will it release per year?</h5>
<p>Our energy usage is expected to cost $321,300,000. Given that our sources of energy are 20% coal, 30% wind, and 50% solar, here are our calculations for the carbon emissions they will produce.<p>
<br>
<p>Given that:</p>
<p>Coal produces 1000 grams of CO2 per kwh (source: <a href= "https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2021/04/28/how-green-is-wind-power-really-a-new-report-tallies-up-the-carbon-cost-of-renewables/">forbes</a>)</p>
<p>Wind turbines produce 11 grams of CO2 per kwh (source: forbes) </p>
<p>Solar produces 44 grams of CO2 per kwh (source: forbes)</p>
<br>
<p>Coal: 100000 people * 15300kwh * 20% * 1000 grams = 3.06*10^11 grams</p>
<p>Wind: 100000 people * 15300kwh * 30% * 11 grams = 5.049*10^9 grams</p>
<p>Solar: 100000 people * 15300kwh * 50% * 44 grams = 3.366*10^10 grams</p>
<p>3.06*10^11 grams + 5.049*10^9 grams + 3.366*10^10 grams = <b> 3.44709*10^11 grams</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>We estimate our city will release 3.45*10^11 grams or 344709 tons per year.</b></p>

    <td>Coal is a low-cost and reliable source of energy. Due to the abundance of research done on coal, production has been optimized & is much less expensive than the newer "green"¬ù counterparts. The infrastructure built around coal is more developed & sophisticated as well. Additionally, coal can be converted into liquid fuels, which emit lower amounts of harmful gases into the air. The emission of harmful gases and particles can be lowered (to a certain extent) by converting coal into liquids.</td>
    <td>Unfortunately, coal is a non-renewable source. Despite its current abundance, there is still a finite supply. Additionally, the use of coal as fuel contributes to global warming. During the energy production process, large amounts of greenhouse gases are released into the air. The burning of coal also emits small particles into the air which add to air pollution. This along with the dependence on world market prices for coal, the need for mining, and the destruction of natural habitats through the mining process (among other disadvantages) makes coal an unhealthy and unsafe fuel to use, especially in the long term.

Since wind turbines themselves run strictly on the power of wind generated, there is no need for fuel. Once the turbine is complete and installed, it doesn't need to be fueled or connected to power to continue working. This also reduces the overall cost to continue to run large-scale wind farms in comparison to <a href="https://justenergy.com/blog/7-types-renewable-energy-future-of-energy/">other forms renewable energies</a>, which require may require some energy investment. wind energy does not contribute to climate change by emitting greenhouse gases during energy production. 
</td>
    <td>
Wind turbines are known to pose a threat to the wildlife. Flying birds and bats whose habitats or migratory paths could be injured or killed if they run into the blades that turn on the fanlike structure  of wind turbines when they are spinning. The deaths of birds and bats are a controversial subject at wind farm sites, which has raised concerns by fish and wildlife conservation groups. Aside from the wildlife that flies through the air, wildlife on the ground may also affected by the noise pollutions generated from whirring blades. <a href="https://justenergy.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wind-energy/">Wind</a> energy additionally suffers from intermittency, which is a disruption caused by the inconsistency of the wind itself. Since wind can blow at various speeds, it's hard to predict the amount of energy it can collect at a given time. (<a href="https://justenergy.com/blog/wind-energy-pros-and-cons/">source</a>)

Solar energy will be available for as long as the sun is available, which makes it a truly renewable source of energy. The use of solar panels will reduce electricity bills as well, since at least some energy needs are being met through energy generated by the sun. Solar panels don't require a lot of maintenance as well, so maintenance costs are not a major worry. The use of solar energy does not contribute to pollution or global warming nearly as much as other fuels such as coal. 

</td>
    <td>
A major disadvantage of solar energy is the cost of implementing it. With the current technology available, the initial cost of solar panels, inverter, batteries, wiring, and installation is far outside of many villager budgets. The efficiency of solar energy relies heavily on sunlight, and although systems are still <i>operational</i> in cloudy/rainy days, solar energy cannot be collected at night. Solar energy systems also take up a lot of space & are very expensive to store.

<p>Our city energy plan was developed with both budget and environmental considerations; we strove to use more energy from sources with smaller carbon emissions but in order to stay within budget, we also had to use nonrenewable sources like coal.</p>
<p>Our city, Animal Crossing 2, is located in Florida. This means that energy usage will be higher due to it being hot as hell. But it also means that energy sources such as solar power are widely accessible and efficient to use. Unfortunately due to budget limitations, we could not power our city with more environmentally friendly energy sources such as nuclear or hydroelectric power (which would cost $0.60 and $0.50 per kwh respectively), and have opted for solar ($0.25/kwh) and wind turbines ($0.25/kwh). There are many benefits to this decision- along with being more environmentally friendly, solar power is again readily available and don't require a lot of maintenance when built properly (some commercial solar panels suffer from planned obsolescence). Wind power also require less maintenance and run strictly using the wind, eliminating a need for fuel. Being renewable sources, both of these options are more available, reduce electricity bills and contribute less to climate change and pollution than other non-renewable sources. However they do come with flaws. Harnessing renewable resources tends to be more costly and inefficient than sources like coal or fossil fuels. Solar technology for instance, costs a lot to install (requires solar panels, batteries, wiring, etc) and also relies on consistent exposure to sun to provide sufficient energy. This shouldn't be a huge problem in good ol Florida but it is a reason that other energy sources are more appealing sometimes. Wind turbines are also flawed, as wind turbine farms take up a huge amount of area and also have a really epic k/d ratio when it comes to birds and bats flying into their gaping maws. They also cause noise pollution and suffer from the same issue that solar panels do which is being inconsistent. However we can remedy some of these issues by placing more emphasis on wildlife conservation and using the land set aside for wind turbines for multiple purposes. For instance, it can also be used for housing or farmlands. Maybe idk lol! There are a lot of different pros and cons but we've weighed the options for a few minutes and this is what we've decided on.</p>
<p>Along with these renewable sources of energy, we have also decided to use 20% coal, with coal being a non-renewable source. This is because coal is low cost and more reliable/consistent than the other two sources. It can be converted into different forms of fuel and most infrastructure currently is built around coal and fossil fuels as a resource. The problem is though is it releases hella CO2 and contributes heavily to air pollution and climate change, releasing 1000 grams per kwh. The economy built around coal is also malicious and exploitative so we have opted to use as little coal as possible to fit within our budget and focus more on other energy sources.</p>
<p>We plan to spend money to implement energy-efficient insulation in buildings, which takes away from our budget but also reduces the amount of energy needed per person. Additionally, we will tax businesses and individuals that use excessive amounts of energy, which will increase income. Factoring in subsidies granted to support our energy plan, our yearly budget is $326,250,000.
<b>We were able to significantly reduce our carbon emissions by incorporating wind and solar energy and using only 20% coal. Our current estimate of how much CO2 will be released per year is 344709 tons, which is a huge step down from our estimate of how much CO2 would be released IF we had used coal as 100% of our energy source- 1686536 tons.</b><p>
